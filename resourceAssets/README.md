# Resource Assets

This folder contains all visual, audio, and other resource assets for the ChronoTower project.

Only asset-related files should be added here.

This folder is maintained separately from game logic to keep responsibilities organized:
- Game code → handled by the developer
- Assets → handled by the asset pipeline

Do not modify files outside this folder when working on the assets branch.
